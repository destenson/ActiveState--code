Welcome to the ActiveState code wiki!

The code repo is a place to share code snippets, recipes and other useful tidbits!

## What is this repo for?

This repo exists to contribute useful snippets, utility functions, and other interesting tidbits in *any* language that may be
helpful to other developers.

## Is there a master list of all the recipes?

You can find the master index of all recipes [here](Recipes-Index).  

*Coming Soon: Search Functionality!*

## How do I submit a new recipe?

1. Fork the code repo.
2. Create your new recipe in the correct language subfolder (create a new folder if it doesn't already exist).
3. Make sure you have included a README as well as your source file.
4. Submit a PR.

*Coming Soon: Submit recipes hosted in your own repo linked back from here!*

## How do I submit a change or revision to a recipe?

Same as above, fork the code repo and submit a PR with your change.

## What license is this code released under?

By default, all newly submitted code is licensed under the MIT license. If your recipe is being released under a different license, please make sure to include a LICENSE file inside your recipe directory.  

All legacy recipes retain their original license. Please see the LICENSE file inside each recipe folder for details..

## How else can I contribute?

Recipes don't always have to be code - great documentation, tutorials, general tips and even general improvements to our [wiki](https://github.com/ActiveState/code/wiki)
are greatly appreciated.
